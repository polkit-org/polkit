 - Make both XML parsers cope with unknown elements; this is necessary
   to keep old processes linking in libpolkit work when doing upgrade
   of PolicyKit where e.g. .policy files with new elements are added.

 - Have someone review the external API

 - Verify the security model

 - Audit all code; especially the setgid polkit_user helper and setuid
   root pam specific helper

 - Granted privileges are currently world-visible; see
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=244941
   for details. This may just be a Fedora-ism. Alternatively, depending
   on what the FHS says, punt it to the distros and ask them to clean
   up the directories during boot?

 - Add missing details to the spec document
   - provide some real world examples e.g. how the example from
     the PolicyKit-gnome app works. Preferably in tutorial form.
   - more detailed description of the internals, e.g. the dirs
     /var/lib/PolicyKit and /var/run/PolicyKit

 - Clean up all man pages

 - Polish the commandline tools (especially polkit-list-actions could
   be nicer)

 - Make sure API coverage is 100%

 - Potentially drop the glib dependency (it's not visible in the
   external API). This is mainly to be able to handle OOM for
   mechanisms that will need this (such as dbus-daemon)

 - add support for additional <match> attributes
   in /etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf

   - <match timeofday="0900-1700">
     Matches 9am through 5pm local time

   - <match weekday="Mon-Fri">
     Matches only on Monday->Friday both inclusive

   - <match selinux_context="regexp">
     Match on caller's SELinux context

   - <match caller_exe="regexp">
     Matches the path of the executable the caller stems from

   - <match group="regexp">
     Match on group

   - <match session_active="true|false">
     Only if the caller is in an active session (or not)

   - <match seat_local="true|false">
     Only if the caller is on a local seat (or not)

   ... And of course the we need the ULTIMATE copout

   - <match run_program="">
     Run a program to make the decision; details are exported in the
     environment. Program cannot assume to run as root or in a specific
     security context; it will need to use a helper a'la
     pam_unix_password.so

 - Reconsider adding k/v dictionaries to Actions; e.g. the Mechanism for
   dial-up networking can attach the key/value pair

     "phone_number" -> "555-123-4567"

   The is a bit like Objects mentioned in the spec (and what we used
   to have as PolKitResource) but a bit more blurry. It may just work.

 - Go to 1.0 soon
